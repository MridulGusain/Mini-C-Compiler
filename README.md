Mini C Compiler

This project implements a simple compiler for a subset of the C programming language using Flex and Bison. It supports basic variable declarations, arithmetic operations, control structures (if-else, while, for), and a print statement. The compiler processes an input file written in the mini C language and generates intermediate code output.

Features
Variable Declarations: Supports int, char, and float variable declarations.

Arithmetic Operations: Handles addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and unary minus.
Control Structures: Supports if, if-else, while, and for loops.

Print Statement: Outputs variable values or expressions.
Return Statement: Allows returning values from the program.
Comparison Operators: Includes ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.

Files
mini_compiler.l: Flex lexer specification for tokenizing the input source code.
mini_compiler.y: Bison parser specification for defining the grammar and generating intermediate code.
mini_compiler.tab.h: Header file generated by Bison, containing token definitions.
input.c: Example input file written in the mini C language.

Prerequisites

To build and run the compiler, you need the following tools installed:
Flex: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
Bison: A parser generator.
GCC: A C compiler for compiling the generated code.



Make: Optional, for using the provided Makefile.
On Ubuntu/Debian, you can install these with:
sudo apt-get install flex bison gcc

Building the Compiler

Generate the lexer and parser code:

flex mini_compiler.l
bison -d mini_compiler.y

Compile the generated code:
gcc lex.yy.c mini_compiler.tab.c -o mini_compiler

Alternatively, if a Makefile is provided, simply run:
make
Running the Compiler
Run the compiler with an input file (e.g., input.c):
./mini_compiler < input.c

The compiler will process the input and produce intermediate code output, such as variable assignments, control structure evaluations, and print statements.
Example Input (input.c)

int a = 1;
int b = 5;

if (a < b) {
    print(a);
} else {
    print(b);
}

while (a < 4) {
    a = a + 1;
    print(a);
}

int i = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i = i + 1) {
    print(i);
}

return a;

Example Output

Running ./mini_compiler < input.c might produce:

=== Mini C Compiler ===
MOV INT a = 1
MOV INT b = 5
IF TRUE BLOCK
PRINT => 1
WHILE BLOCK executed once (demo)
MOV a = 2
PRINT => 2
WHILE BLOCK executed once (demo)
MOV a = 3
PRINT => 3
WHILE BLOCK executed once (demo)
MOV a = 4
PRINT => 4
MOV INT i = 0
FOR INIT: i = 0
FOR BODY (simulated once)
PRINT => 0
FOR UPDATE: i = 1
RETURN => 4

Limitations
The compiler currently generates intermediate code and does not produce executable machine code.
The while and for loops are simulated to execute only once in this version for simplicity.
Limited error handling; unrecognized tokens are reported but may not halt execution gracefully.
Variable types (int, char, float) are declared but treated as integers in the intermediate code.
